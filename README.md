Instructions for Testing:
Add the DynamicForm component to your project.
Ensure that you have React set up and running.
Render the DynamicForm component in your application (e.g., within a route or a container component).
Fill in the form fields (Name, Email, Password) and click the “Submit” button.
Observe the alerts for validation errors (e.g., empty fields, minimum character length).
Verify that the form submission logic (console log) works as expected.
